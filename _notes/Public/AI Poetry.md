Productivity is a priveleged concern,
Struck at the dull red thing of their thirst,
Along thy bounds they are yet return.
Bloom down the wide aisles of your woe.

Productivity is a priveleged concern
struck at by the dull moments of thirst.
Along thy plate they are yet to return, 
long hours of last unto first.
